To compile the program, please type "make proj2" in the command line.
To run the program, please type "./proj2" in the command line.

After the program is running, type 1 and hit enter to display the sphere with texture. Type 2 and hit enter to read the specific file and display it with texture. Type any other thing at the beginning of the program to terminate the program. The instruction will pop out at the very beginning of the program.

For the .ply file and .data file location, please make a directory in the same folder of proj2.c and put .ply and .data file in that directory. For example, chair.ply and chair.data should have same following path: "chair/chair.ply", "chair/chair.data". For nike file, just make a directory named nike and put nike.ply in the nike directory. 
To run the program, if you want to display nike.ply but the opengl canonical view is black, please terminate the program and rerun it, and then it will display nike. 

If you have any question, please send an email to yuh94@pitt.edu
